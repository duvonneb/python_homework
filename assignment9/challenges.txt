Challenges in Task 6: Scraping Structured Data

    1. Incorrect XPath Target
    Getting the "find_elements" line to work properly was challenging to get correctly. 
    However, I was able to copy the XPATH using the developer tools in Chrome and it helped me fulled the elements I needed.

    2. Empty or Incorrect CSV Output
    Because of the incorrect XPath and lack of filtering, my CSV file was initially empty or contained unrelated data. 
    After fixing the XPath and applying filtering to extract only valid title-link pairs, the CSV output was correct.

    These challenges helped me better understand how to navigate the DOM using browser developer tools and how to use XPath effectively in Selenium to target specific elements on a web page.
